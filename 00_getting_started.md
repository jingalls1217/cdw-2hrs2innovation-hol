- Multi-function analytics - Data Services; today we’ll just focus on the Cloudera Data Warehouse Data Service

- There are other Data Services that usually are part of an Analytic use case 

  - Data Flow - for data ingestion needs
  - Data Engineering - for ELT/ETL, transformations, data wrangling, etc.
  - Machine Learning - for Data Science teams to collaboratively build and productionalize ML/AI applications and models for the Enterprise

- However, Cloudera provides other services such as Data Catalog, Replication Manager, Workload Manager, and Management Console provide continuity and functionality throughout the platform.

Note: The platform removes the necessity to spend unnecessarily on integration tax, where other solutions combine various pieces together in the ability to provide continuity and functionality throughout an end-to-end use case but this is difficult because it introduces many moving parts.
